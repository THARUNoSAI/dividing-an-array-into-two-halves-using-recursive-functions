Write a C program to divide the integer array into two
halves using function recursion. Call the user-defined “divide” function
recursively, with the left half of the split array being passed as an argument for that
function. Let the recursive function to get executed until the array size
becomes one. Count the number of iterations to reach the base
condition.
